Full Stack course by University of Helsinki assignments are in one repository just for the sake of clarity. The course is divided in parts ('osa' in Finnish),
of which only the part 3 is in it's own repository as recommended by the course instructors. In all of the parts you'll find pieces of code that might be a bit
weird looking as I'm learning on the way. So the latest code with the most skills is in the parts with bigger numbers. The parts are divided in smaller parts 
according to the project name.
